The solution begins with gathering and preprocessing transactional, customer, and store performance data, setting the stage for valuable insights. We engineer features like recency, frequency, and monetary values to get a clear picture of customer behavior. Using K-means clustering, customers are segmented into distinct groups based on their shopping patterns and engagement levels. RFM analysis helps identify high-value customers, so we can focus on delivering personalized, impactful experiences rather than just promotional emails that often go unnoticed.

Next, we perform an age group analysis to understand spending patterns across different demographics, ensuring that marketing strategies are tailored for maximum relevance. When it comes to store performance, we evaluate revenue, footfall, and size to identify both high-performing and underperforming locations. This allows for smarter resource allocation and helps pointing out the cities with strong demand but no physical store presence for potential expansion.

Market Basket Analysis, powered by the Apriori algorithm, reveals product associations, sparking cross-selling opportunities that resonate with customer preferences. A recommendation system based on products frequently bought together is integrated to suggest complementary items, driving sales and enhancing the customer shopping experience.

The Next Best Action is then determined by blending rule-based strategies with machine learning, ensuring that actions like offering VIP rewards, discounts, or reactivation incentives are both timely and relevant. These actions are delivered via a WhatsApp chatbot, making them easy to engage with and ensuring customers receive personalized offers directly on their devices. This approach drives customer loyalty, optimizes marketing efforts, and boosts revenueâ€”all while avoiding the clutter of promotional emails that often get overlooked.
